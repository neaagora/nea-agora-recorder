### **Nea Agora Service Recorder -- Status**

v0.3 – Introduced copy behavior as the first post-output behavioral signal.

**Current version:** v0.3
**Status:** ✅ Implemented, validated, ready to ship

**What v0.3 adds**

-   First real behavioral signal beyond prompts

-   Passive observation of user copy behavior

-   Clean separation between raw evidence and interpretation

**What it does not do**

-   No success/failure inference

-   No engagement scoring

-   No cross-session aggregation

-   No UI or dashboards

**Why this matters**

-   Establishes a pattern for behavioral evidence collection

-   Proves the recorder can observe meaningful post-output actions

-   Lays groundwork for audit, compliance, and trust records without opinionated logic

**Next**

-   v0.4 candidates:

    -   derive legacy copy flags from copy events, or deprecate them

    -   add time-to-first-copy as a derived metric

    -   introduce second behavioral signal (edit, retry, or paste-back)
