# Nea Agora Service Recorder – v0.4 Status

**Version:** v0.4  
**Status:** Implemented, validated, ready to ship  
**Date:** 2026-01-23

## Summary

v0.4 completes the first full behavioral observation loop for ChatGPT sessions.

This release does not introduce new outcome logic, scoring, or UI features.  
It focuses on turning raw interaction events into reliable, human-readable behavioral evidence.

## What v0.4 Adds

### 1. Derived Copy Usage Metrics

v0.4 derives existing summary fields from `copy_output` events:

- `copiedOutput`
- `copiedCodeBlock`
- `copiedTextLength`
- `timeToFirstCopySec`

These values are computed deterministically from observed copy behavior.

No inference or interpretation is applied.

### 2. UI Copy Button Detection

In addition to selection-based copy detection, v0.4 records copy actions triggered via ChatGPT UI buttons:

- Copy full reply
- Copy code block

These actions are recorded as `copy_output` events with a `trigger` field:

- `selection`
- `button_full_reply`
- `button_code_block`

This captures real-world workflows where users copy entire replies or code blocks without manual selection.

### 3. Feedback (Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down) Events

v0.4 introduces passive observation of explicit user feedback:

- `feedback_good`
- `feedback_bad`

Per-session summary fields include:

- `feedbackGoodCount`
- `feedbackBadCount`
- `feedbackMessageIds`

No semantic meaning is inferred from feedback at this stage.

## What v0.4 Does Not Do

- No success/failure scoring
- No trust or quality ranking
- No outcome reinterpretation
- No UI changes
- No cross-session aggregation

All signals remain observational and session-scoped.

## Backward Compatibility

- v0.4 is backward-compatible with v0.3 records.
- All new metadata fields are optional.
- Older records continue to parse and summarize correctly.

## Why This Release Matters

v0.4 is the first version where the service record reflects how users actually work with ChatGPT:

- Copying entire replies into editors
- Copying code blocks via UI controls
- Providing explicit feedback

This establishes a concrete foundation for auditability, analysis, and future agent-to-agent trust systems based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.
