# Nea Agora Service Recorder — v0.5 Status

## Summary

v0.5 extends the service recorder with **LLM-side message tracking** and stabilizes session behavior for publication and dogfooding.

This release intentionally prioritizes **observable behavior** over inferred structure.

---

## What’s New in v0.5

### LLM Message Counting
- Added `llmMessageCount` metric.
- Counts assistant replies observed in the DOM.
- Works reliably for fresh chats and long-running sessions.

### User Message Counting
- Added `userMessageCount` metric.
- Tracks user send actions consistently.

### Session Semantics (Explicit)
- **Session scope = browser tab lifetime**.
- Switching chats within the same tab aggregates metrics.
- New tabs create clean, independent sessions.

This behavior is intentional for v0.5 and documented as such.

---

## Stability Notes

- Counts are internally consistent within a session.
- Minor off-by-one cases may occur during rapid UI transitions.
- No attempt is made to infer conversation boundaries.

---

## Debug & Logging

- v0.5 bring-up debug logs are commented out.
- Recorder logs are gated behind a single debug flag.
- Default behavior is quiet.

---

## Known Limitations

- Sessions are tab-scoped, not conversation-scoped.
- No per-message or per-span feedback yet.
- No token-level or semantic analysis.

These are planned for future iterations.
